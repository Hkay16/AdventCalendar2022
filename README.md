# AdventCalendar2022

This repository is for my attempts at completing the 25 days of challenges from the Advent of Code 2022 event.

Each day's challenge has a folder containing a README (which includes the challenge description and the answers), the input file, and my attempt.

My goal is to challenge myself to use multiple languages, including those I am not very familiar with. Since I know C++ very well, I decided to use that one less.
